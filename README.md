# 📈 Loan Prediction model  — Using ML Algorithms

This project determines how to implement **ML Algorithms** to predict **Loan status** based on **Loan Approvals**.The major aim of this notebook is to
predict which of the customers will have their loan approved. In addition to achieving high classification accuracy, this notebook will explore whether
similar evaluation metrics can be maintained with a distint feature set.

## 📂 Dataset

Complete Dataset consists of 2 CSV files . One of them is training and other is for testing your model. 
The dataset contains a set of 613 records under 13 attributes:

## 🔧 Libraries Used

- `pandas` — Data loading and manipulation  
- `numpy` — Numerical operations  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — Data visualization  
- `sklearn` — Machine learning (model, training, evaluation)

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

1. **Import Libraries**  
2. **Upload and Read CSV Dataset**
3. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Checked for null values  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Countplot visualization using seaborn  
5. **Train-Test Split**  
   - 75:25 ratio using `train_test_split()`  
6. **Model Creation**  
   - Using `ML Algorithms` from scikit-learn  
7. **Prediction**  
   - Predicted values for test data  
8. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - F1_score 
   - Accuracy_score 
   - Precision_score  
   - Recall_score
   - Confusion_Matrix
9. **Visualization**  
   - plots of **Loan ID vs Loan Approval**

## 📊 Evaluation Output

```  
Accuracy_score:
F1_score : 
precision_score :
recall_score : 
```

This indicates a good accuracy prediction model.

## 📌 Visualization

Some plots are generated to show the ** Loan Id vs Loan Approval** values with a reference bar:

- X-axis →   
- Y-axis →
